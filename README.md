### Usage

```bash
npm i -D @swc/core swc-plugin-purescript-esm
```

```js
import { plugin } from "swc-plugin-purescript-esm";
import { transformSync } from "@swc/core";

// For a directory example with spago see /example
const pursOutput = `
// Generated by purs version 0.14.5
"use strict";
var Effect_Console = require("../Effect.Console/index.js");
var main = Effect_Console.log("\ud83c\udf5d");
module.exports = {
    main: main
};
`
const { code } = transformSync(pursOutput, { plugin: plugin() });
console.log(code);

/**
import ___Effect_Console_index_js_b8b84996 from "../Effect.Console/index.js";
;
var Effect_Console = ___Effect_Console_index_js_b8b84996;
var main = Effect_Console.log("üçù");
export { main };

This module is experimental, just using it for some experiments
with building Purescript.

Purescript compiler doesn't currently support ESM output and
would be nice if it did for tree-shaking etc.

This plugin for SWC can take an output directory created by
Spago for instance and transpile it from the spago output
module format (commonjs with module.exports) into ESM.

This tool is very specifically focused on some anecdotal compiler
output from Purescript and definitely will not handle edge cases.
